            <h2>What is VAR</h2>
            <p>VAR, the video assistant referee, is now the new 5th referee during a soccer game. The process works by 
                having a central location that monitors the soccer game with multiple camera angles to slow down and zoom
                 in on questionable plays. The main referee can communicate with the VAR team replay operator to review an
                  obvious error and change the field call.  How do referees signal that they want a video review of a play,
                   and what plays can they review? Can fans see what the video replay during a game? </p>

            <h2>What does VAR solve</h2>
            <p>One of the pros of VAR is the ability of a referee to make an informed decision regarding an incident during
                a match. If you’ve been following soccer for a while or if you’re an ardent fan of the game, you know very
                well that the decisions of a referee carry a great deal of significance. Before the introduction of VAR,
                it was not possible for a referee to overturn a decision following an incidence. </p>
        </article>
        <article id="section-3">
            <h2>How to use this innovation</h2>
            <p>VAR can be used to review four types of decision: goals and the violations that precede them, red cards, 
                penalties, and mistaken identity when awarding a card. In some cases, a decision made by the main referee
                 can be overturned; however, it must be a “clear error” for this to happen.Typically, the process for 
                 reviewing a decision works in one of two ways: either the VAR team can recommend a review, or the main 
                 referee can request a review after making a decision.

            <h2>Who is using this innovation</h2>
            <p>As mentioned previously, there are four situations when VAR can be used in the game. The first is for goals
                 and offences leading up to the goal, the second is offside penalty decisions and offences preceding the 
                 penalty, the third is direct red card incidents, and the fourth is mistaken identity. Essentially, any 
                 potential fouls outside of the penalty box will not be reviewed unless they are in the build-up to a goal 
                 or penalty decision or are worthy of a red card
            </p>
        </article>
        <article id="section-5">
            <h2>what to expect</h2>
            <p>If an incident needs to be reviewed, the VAR team study the footage and notify their findings to the 
                referee through an earpiece. If this happens, the referee will notify the players by pointing to his 
                ear or by making the official VAR review signal to show that a decision is being reviewed. He can then 
                either review the incident on the side of the pitch or accept the VAR information and take the necessary
                action.</p>

            <h2>Future of this innovation</h2>
            <p>The VAR barely has a couple of seasons expanding through football and reaching major competitions and both
                 FIFA and Hawk-Eye, the leading company of this technology in the world, They are working on version 2.0 in 
                 order to ensure that it does more and more justice. As FIFA previously reported, they are testing an 
                 innovation in the offside system to make it automatic and more effective. It is about advancing 
                 technologically as the referees expand their experience with this tool and try to reach a more complete 
                 use in search of zero error in decision-making.</p>
